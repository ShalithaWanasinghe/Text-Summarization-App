"By . Snejana Farberov . PUBLISHED: . 00:09 EST, 7 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:44 EST, 29 July 2013 . Six people were killed when a building being demolished collapsed Wednesday and nearly obliterated an adjacent Salvation Army thrift store, among the dead a woman who only recently got engaged, a young art student and a mother of nine. The mayor's office identified the victims as Anne Bryan, Roseline Conteh, Borbor Davis, Kimberly Finnegan, Juanita Harmin and Mary Simpson. The 13 people pulled alive from the rubble are Susan Randall, Betty Brown, Shirley Ball, Linda Bell, Jennifer Reynolds, Nadine White, Margarita Agosta, Richard Stasiorowski, Rosemary Kreutzberg, Rodney Geddis, Felicia Hill, Daniel Johnson and Myra Plekan. Wasteland: A four-story building being demolished collapsed Wednesday on the edge of downtown, killing six and injuring 13 people . Cleanup: A firefighter sprays the debris on Market Street in Philadelphia, which is all that was left from a building . ‘Our deepest condolences go out to the families and friends of the deceased,’ Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said during a press conference Tuesday. ‘I ask all Philadelphians to remember those who perished and their families in their prayers and thoughts.’ While city officials and the victims’ loved ones began picking up the pieces in the aftermath of the tragedy, new questions were being raised about the cause of the collapse. It was revealed Thursday that nearly a month before the deadly collapse that ended the lives of six people, the City of Philadelphia had been made aware of potentially unsafe demolition practices at the site. NBC Philadelphia reported that Center City resident Stephen Field, 49, called the municipal hotline on May 6 to express his concerns that the demolitions crew dismantling a building at 2134 Market Street used no safety equipment and had no protection for pedestrians. New beginning: Kimberly Finnegan, 35, just got engaged two weeks ago and was working her first day as a cashier at the downtown store when she was killed . Lives cut short: Borbor Davis, 68,  (left), pictured with his wife, Maggie,  died working at the Salvation Army store; Anne Bryan, 24, a first-year student at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, was shopping at the store when the building came down . In memory: A reporter makes a photograph of a makeshift memorial for Kimberly J. Finnegan near the scene of a building collapse . 'There was nothing resembling efforts to prevent people walking by from being hit with brick,' he told the station. Licensing & inspection data shows contractor Griffin Campbell Construction was handing demolition at multiple adjacent properties along the 2100 block of Market Street, including house number 2136, which came crashing down on Wednesday. All three properties were either owned by or have ties to New York-based STB Investments. Field said that after some back-and-forth with a city representative, he was notified that an inspector visited the site in question and found no safety violations. At a press conference Thursday morning, Philadelphia Department of Licenses & Inspections Commissioner Carlton Williams said that 2136 Market Street was not inspected because demolition work had not begun at the time of Field's complaint. Loving mothers: Juanita Harmon, 75, a retired secretary, is survived by four grown sons; Roseline Coneth, 52, an immigrant from Sierra Leone who worked as a certified nursing assistant, was a mother of nine . The 49-year, however, insists that he witnessed crews doing demolition work on both sites before he called the helpline. In a press release this afternoon, Williams said that the city will now begin conducting 'proactive inspections' of all private demolitions. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter pledged a 'wide-ranging' investigation into the collapse. John Dougherty, head of Local 98 of the electrical workers' union, called the deadly collapse a 'sad metaphor' for the city's construction process, adding that his group had been concerned in recent years with similar demolition sites. The collapse of the building left six people dead, and in the hours after the tragic incident, their stories slowly began to emerge as their families struggled to come to terms with their loss. Anne Bryan, 24, was a first-year student at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts who was described by teachers there as ‘dynamic, inquisitive and smart.’ Allegations: It was revealed that nearly a month before the deadly collapse that ended the lives of six people, the City of Philadelphia had been made aware of potentially unsafe demolition practices at the site . Official response: Mayor Michael Nutter, center, pledged a 'wide-ranging' investigation into the collapse . Philadelphia Department of Licenses & Inspections Commissioner Carlton Williams said that 2136 Market Street was not inspected last month because demolition work had not begun at the time . Her family called her a talented art student and generous friend, sister and daughter. ‘That she will not be here to continue to touch the lives of those around her is of intense pain to all of our family and her friends. This pain is fresh and it runs deep,’ the family said in a statement that asked for privacy. Bryan had been shopping at the thrift store when the edifice crumpled to the ground. Borbor Davis, 68, of Darby, was a Liberian immigrant who died working at the Salvation Army store. His stepdaughter called him a hardworking man and devoted husband. ‘He loved my mom so much,’ said Maryann M. Mason said, who said they'd been married several years. ‘They looked so good together.’ Davis’ wife, Maggie, told CBS Philadelphia that her husband called her just 15 minutes before the collapse. At 10.45am, she got a frantic call from her daughter telling her to turn on the TV. ‘I took out my phone right away and called him, he didn't answer me, and we had just put the phone down 15 minutes, so I call him again and I been calling him, he never answered,’ said Davis. The widow described her husband as a kind-hearted, Christian man who loved his job and never missed a day of work. Kimberly Finnegan, 35, of Philadelphia, was working her first day as a cashier at the downtown store after about a year at a Salvation Army shop in the city's Roxborough neighborhood, where she lived. She got engaged only two weeks ago, according to her brother, Bob Coleman. ‘The main thing, I think right now, is how incredibly happy she was,’ Coleman said. Juanita Harmon, 75, a retired secretary and a mother of four grown sons, loved to travel and shop, according to her family. Her son Andre said she would often go to the Salvation Army store to find him and his brothers special items. Dramatic moment: A dust cloud rises as people run from the scene of a building collapse on the edge of downtown Philadelphia, which killed six people . Rescue continues: Emergency personnel and others pull a man from the rubble . Seeking signs of life: A Philadelphia Firefighter, center, lays with his hand thrust into an empty area underneath a clothing rack . 'Certain people deserve certain things in life, and what she deserved she didn’t get,’ said friend Michael Morgan. Roseline Coneth, 52, an immigrant from Sierra Leone, worked as a certified nursing assistant, her loved ones told the station, adding that she came to the country to make their lives better. She was a mother of nine who enjoyed bargain-hunting - a hobby that brought her to the thrift store on Wednesday morning. Her grieving family are now planning to send her body back to her native West Africa for burial. So far, no information has been released on the sixth victim, Mary Simpson.","The mayor's office identified the victims as Anne Bryan, Roseline Conteh, Borbor Davis, Kimberly Finnegan, Juanita Harmin and Mary Simpson .

"(CNN) -- Issac is expected to move over Arkansas on Friday and over southern Missouri Friday night after lingering over the Louisiana area dumping heavy rains for days. After making landfall on Tuesday night as a powerful Category 1 hurricane, Issac has weakened and was downgraded to a tropical storm than a tropical depression. It came virtually on the same day, seven years after Katrina devastated Louisiana and for some Issac felt too much like the deadly hurricane that is blamed for the deaths of 1,800 people. ""This is unbelievable. Deja vu, man,"" said Billy Nungesser, the president of Plaquemines Parish, Thursday as he surveyed the hard-hit town of Ironton that was inundated by floodwaters and sludge. ""There is more water here than Katrina."" But for the many that braced for the worse and were spared, Friday is a day to breath a sigh of relief and to continue to clean up the mess Issac left behind. State government offices in at least 13 parishes would remained closed Friday because of flooding and most others would reopen, CNN affiliate WBRZ reported. Emergency crews were also trying to restore power to many. More than 827,000 customers -- down from 915,000 earlier in the day -- had no electricity across Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, utility companies reported Thursday. One company, Coast Electric Power, reduced a high of 30,000 outages to 8,000 by Thursday evening . The bodies of a man and woman were found in 7 feet of water at a home in Plaquemines Parish, officials said late Thursday. An autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause of the death of the couple, described as being their 40s, Nungesser told CNN. The two were found late Thursday afternoon in the home's kitchen. The house is on the parish's East Bank, said Commander Terry Rutherford of the Plaquemines Parish Sheriff's Office. Officials also intentionally breached a levee in Plaquemines Parish, southeast of New Orleans. The move was needed to help drain floodwaters in the Braithwaite and Scarsdale communities. In Tangipahoa, Parish President Gordon Burgess called for a mandatory evacuation for those living within a half mile of the Tangipahoa River. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said the move was a precaution because if the dam were to break it would only take 90 minutes for floodwaters to get to Kentwood, a town of about 2,200 residents. Later Thursday, Burgess said he did not know how many people had been evacuated along the 54-mile stretch of the river. Kentwood saw 75 people move. ""I'm feeling much more comfortable tonight and I'm going to sleep better tonight,"" Burgess said. The storm has had a ""major impact"" on Mississippi, Gov. Phil Bryant said in Gulfport said Thursday. Also officials in Mississippi earlier reported a storm-related death. A tow truck driver attempting to clear debris on a road was struck and killed by a falling tree, officials said. The incident took place at midnight, said Amanda Harris, deputy director of the Pearl River County Emergency Management office. The National Weather Service said it received reports of the fatality in Picayune. An earthen dam on 700-acre Lake Tangipahoa in Mississippi was holding its own and not leaking late Thursday, despite significant damage, according to the Pike County Emergency Management Agency. Agency director Richard Coghlan said a ""controlled breach"" or spillway will be created at the Percy Quin State Park lake to relieve pressure and drain it. Crews were working carefully overnight, moving in equipment to prepare for the operation expected to commence later Friday once water levels drop a bit. ""They don't want to influence the level of the river any more than they have to."" Residents of 19 houses and seven mobile homes, along with three businesses, below the lake were asked to evacuate. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency does not expect a catastrophic event, said spokesman Greg Flynn. Coghlan agreed with that assessment. Water levels in most affected areas will gradually subside Friday, the hurricane center said, concluding its reports on Isaac. Isaac moved into southern Arkansas Thursday afternoon, bringing with it the possibility of flash flooding and tornadoes. ""It's looking more disorganized but it is still putting out quite a bit of rain,"" said National Weather Service meteorologist Charles Dalton in Little Rock. Rainfall around Little Rock could total 5 inches by Friday, said Dalton. Higher numbers were expected in the southeastern portion of Arkansas. CNN's Brian Todd contributed to this report.","NEW: Two bodies found at home in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana .

But, incredibly, instead of becoming lunch it was allowed to bask in the hot South Carolina sun on the back of one of the predators. The amazing picture was taken by photographer Mac Stone, who had to set up an intricate camera rig to capture the creatures in their natural habitat. Unlikely alliance: Instead of eating the turtle the alligator allows it to sit on its back as they bask in the river . Mr Stone spent four months in the stifling heat of the Francis Beidler Forest tracking the animals. But he was unable to get the picture he wanted because the shy creatures would sink into the water when he appeared. So the photographer built a rig on the log to allow him to catch the animals behaving naturally. The high-tech camera took a picture every five minutes over two weeks so the alligators and turtles could go undisturbed. It was only when Mr Stone went through the images that he realised he had caught the rare image. Mr Stone said: 'I was actually . nowhere in sight during this photo. I tried for nearly a month to make . photos of this behaviour but had no luck because the alligators and . turtles would just slide off into the water anytime I came near. On the run: The turtle looked in trouble when it was caught on the same log as the alligator in South Carolina . Cornered: The amphibian's escape route is blocked by a second alligator, which do eat turtles in the wild . 'So, . I built I custom rig for my camera to mount atop the log and used . what's called an intervalometer to take a photo every five minutes . throughout the day for two weeks. 'Every morning, I would paddle out to the log and set up the camera and then return in the evening to retrieve the camera. 'The gators and turtles didn't mind the camera and continued to clamour for space on the prime basking spot in the swamp. 'What . was revealed was an interesting series of photographs that shows how . gators and turtles interact when prime real estate is limited.' American alligators can grow up to 11ft and eat a range of animals and fish, including turtles and snakes.","Marc Stone spent months tracking creatures in South Carolina swamp .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Soviet spies have admitted using bugging devices on the Royal Family and former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson. Secret agents from the KGB targeted Princess Margaret in the 1960s, attaching listening aids to her lighter, cigarette case, ashtrays and telephones. According to the Sunday Express, they homed in on the Princess during a trip to Copenhagen, Denmark in 1964. Lord Snowdon And Princess Margaret get ready to board a plane in September 1964 ahead of their visit to Copenhagen. Russian spies have admitted bugging the Princess on the trip . Until now, Russia has always denied the covert operation, which took place in a hotel, but has now admitted compiling a dossier on the Princess's love affair with Robin Douglas-Home and further relationships with Roddy Llewellyn, Colin Tennant and Dominic Ewes, a painter who later committed suicide. Spies passed photos, tape recordings and 'most interesting, even scandalous' gossip involving senior royal figures. It is also said agents tried to get information from Margaret's therapist, Kay Kiernan, who also treated the Queen. Intelligence on Prince Phillip was gathered via society osteopath and artist Stephen Ward, who later killed himself at the height of the Profumo affair. But spies failed in a sting operation on then future leader Harold Wilson, setting up a 'honey trap' for him in a Moscow hotel. Princess Margaret (second from right and then left) was targeted by KGB spies on her visit to Copenhagen in 1964. Bugging devices were planted in her lighter, cigarette case, ashtrays and telephones . A new book will detail the KGB spies' attempts at bugging the Royal Family. Pictured, the Kremlin, in Moscow . Female agents posing as prostitutes patrolled the hotel overlooking the Kremlin, with a camera planted in a chandelier in his bedroom. But when the film was developed, Wilson's face was disguised. Colonel Vadim Goncharov, who has since died, was the KGB chief in charge of the snooping operations, and he was ordered by bosses to go on television to deny the claims, fearing they would cast a shadow over the Queen's first and only visit to Russia in 1994. But last week Russia newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda boasted that among Goncharov's successes was 'the bugging of drunken parties of the British Princess Margaret'. A book published next year, Entitled The Kremlin v The Windsors, by the paper's intelligence analyst Gennady Sokolov will provide further details of the operation, according to the paper. Master spy Goncharov, who staged stings in more than 100 countries and survived assassination attempts, said of the Princess Margaret operation: 'As I recall there were no lovers, though there was a visitor. 'On this occasion our interest was in getting confidential information which would open certain doors for us in Britain.' On the failed attempt at trapping Wilson, he said: 'It was if he was playing games with us.'","KGB homed in on Princess during visit to Copenhagen in 1964 .

"By . Sara Nathan . They have made no secret of their growing love after spending the past few months jet setting around the world together. And one of Michelle Rodriguez's closest confidants has revealed she is so in love with British supermodel Cara Delevingne that she believes she is 'the one' - and wants to start a family with her. In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, the friend of the Fast and Furious . star - who has asked to remain unnamed - reveals how Michelle, 35, is so besotted by Cara, 21, that she . has already told pals she would love a baby with her. But while the actress is planning her future with Cara - who is 14 years younger than her - we can reveal the Mulberry model’s family is terrified of the influence the wayward star is having on the top model who has become the toast of the fashion industry. Scroll down for videos . Inseparable: Before jetting to Italy Cara, 21, and 35-year-old Michelle were seen out on the town in London . The start of something: Model Cara Delevingne shared a kiss . with openly bisexual actress Michelle Rodriguez as they sat courtside at the . New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden in January. Baring all: Michelle Rodriguez shared a photo on Instagram on Tuesday which showed her stark naked while meditating . The . source, who Michelle regularly confides in, said: 'Michelle comes from . a broken home and it has a lot to do with why she has found herself in . trouble again and again throughout her life. 'Constantly, . she pushes boundaries and has been in trouble with the law, but really . all of it is because she is desperate to be loved. 'Her mom and dad separated when she was a child and ever since Michelle has been yearning for some stability in her life. 'Sadly after years of dating older women and men like Olivier Martinez, nothing seemed to work out for her. 'But now Cara has come along, who is so much younger than the women she normally dates, but suddenly Michelle is happy again.' In . recent years, former Lost star Michelle, who openly admits she is bisexual, has endured a string of broken relationships after dating French heartthrob and S.W.A.T co-star Olivier Martinez, Fast and Furious co-star Vin Diesel as well as model Claudette Lali, director Francesca De Sola and . model Aleksandra Rastovic. The source claims Michelle had a 'great thing' going with Terminator 3 actress Kristanna Loken - who strongly hinted to Advocate magazine that she was in a relationship with her in 2006, yet Michelle has never confirmed their relationship. 'Kristanna wanted to come out as a couple. She's proud to be bisexual, but Michelle wasn't ready to go public,' said the friend: 'So instead of working it out, Michelle ended it. Smitten: Michelle was linked with Terminator 3 actress Kristanna Loken, who hinted the couple were in a relationship in 2006 . Ex-lovers: Michelle Rodriguez iis said to have dated flimmaker Francesca de Sola. The pair are pictured at the screening of Francesca's film 1%ers in New York in April 2013 . 'Then she was left heartbroken a year later when she fell for another model/actress only to find out she had slept with someone else while she was away filming the movie Avatar.' The actress has also found herself behind bars after being in trouble repeatedly with the . law. In March 2002, she was . charged with assault and harassment when her girlfriend, Louise Ward, . claimed the tough girl had attacked her in their New Jersey apartment. Ward was left battered and bruised, but later dropped all charges against Michelle. The friend said: 'Michelle can be intense and dive head first into . romances. This can land her in hot water as she found out with Louise. 'Over the last 15-years there have been countless other examples of her disastrous love life.' Just one year later Michelle found herself in trouble again when she . appeared in court to face eight misdemeanor charges relating to two . driving incidents, including a DUI and a hit and run. In . 2004, she pleaded no contest to three of the charges, hit and run, . drunken driving and driving with a suspended license and went to jail . for 48 hours and was placed on probation for three years. And in 2005, while filming ABC hit Lost in Hawaii, the stunning brunette was fined multiple times for speeding. Later . that year on December 1st she was arrested for drunk driving, to which . she pleaded guilty and paid a $500 fine and spent five days in jail. Due . to this being a clear violation of her earlier drunk driving crimes, . she was also sentenced to 60 days in jail, but due to overcrowding was . released on the same day she entered. And it's precisely this behavior that has left Cara's family a little fearful. Michelle's close friend admitted: 'She's a very free spirit and before this relationship she has always been terrified of commitment. “And because of her troubled past, many of them have essentially had to be her babysitter or a mother figure to her. 'So now Cara might be younger than her, but she honestly thinks this is 'the one'. Just before she met Cara she was talking about wanting a family within the next couple of years. Lovers? Michelle Rodriguez reportedly dated Vin Diesel, her Fast and Furious co-star. The pair pose at the premiere of Fast and Furious 6 in Seoul, South Korea, in May 2013 . Ex-love: Michelle Rodriguez was also said to have dated her S.W.A.T co-star Olivier Martinez. The actor is now married to Halle Berry . 'She . really wants a baby and wants one soon and now she has found Cara she . thinks this could finally be the time to chase that dream. 'Sadly due to Michelle’s troubled past, Cara’s family are not so sure.They are not 100 per cent pro this relationship and are in some ways willing it to end. 'The 14-year age gap between the girls concerns them as does Michelle's wayward reputation. 'They . know Cara has been swept off her feet by Michelle, who has dropped . everything to be with her young love, but the family fear the . relationship will end in nothing but disaster. 'I highly doubt at 21-years-old Cara is ready to start a family. She is no doubt currently smitten with Michelle, who dropped everything, including her girlfriend and friends, to be with her. 'But . if anyone is going to get their heart broken in this relationship it's . going to be Michelle. She will smother Cara, and wants to be around her . 24 hours a day.' The couple, who apparently met in . January, were also seen attending Prince's secret gig at Ronnie Scott's . club on Monday, February 17, and the Elle Style Awards the following . evening before heading to Milan to . close the autumn/winter fashion season. They then hired a private jet last week to head to Milan Fashion Week, where Cara had a busy schedule. The pair were spotted in coordinating black outfits while carrying bags as they made their way to their airplane - while the Brit beauty's parents were also along for the trip. After landing in Milan, Michelle sat with her love as she sat in hair and makeup backstage at the Fendi autumn/winter 2014 fashion show. They then flew back to London and are now believed to be on vacation. Supportive: The Fast And Furious star hung out with her model squeeze backstage at Milan Fashion Week . Romantic getaway: It seems Michelle's girlfriend Cara Delevingne might be on the Thailand holiday too as that same day she shared a photo of herself wearing scuba diving gear while in a tropical location . Sexy couple: Michelle's post came days after Cara shared this snapshot . Michelle spoke openly about her sexuality in October after years of speculation, telling Entertainment Weekly, 'I've never walked the carpet with anyone, so they wonder: What does she do with her vagina?"" Plus, I play a butchy girl all the time, so they assume I'm a lesbo.' Asked about the assumptions, she admitted: 'Eh, they're not too far off. I've gone both ways. I do as I please. I am too f--king curious to sit here and not try when I can. Men are intriguing. So are chicks.' This week, Michelle posted a picture of herself naked, revealing her bare derriere to the world as she appeared to be meditating. She was seen lapping up the sunshine in Thailand, where she is . currently enjoying a getaway, and the snapshot also showed a stunning . ocean view. And it is likely that the photo was taken by Cara, as that same day the model shared a picture of herself clad . in scuba diving gear in an equally tropical location. Michelle’s snap comes just days after her model squeeze shared her own extremely sexy picture on the social networking site. The source added: 'You can see from the photos of them out together in London that they are clearly having fun. 'They . don't seem to have a care in the world and I know Michelle will pay for . everything, go everywhere with her and has unlimited funds to do as . they please. 'To begin with . this will be nice and she will be flattered. But when she has to go . away to shoot a film, it will end and Michelle does fall hard. 'And maybe it will all be a little too much for someone as young as Cara.' Turning heads: Michelle attended the BAFTAs in London earlier this month in a silk and leather plunging gown .

"Clearly Jesus was sexy. After all, He is the Son of God. I don't mean to be disrespectful, but as I watched the trailer for the new movie, ""Son of God,"" I found myself gawking at the actor portraying Jesus. Diogo Morgado is one hot dude. His Jesus looks more like Brad Pitt than that nice man with the beard in all those paintings. I'm not the only one gawking at Morgodo's Jesus. He inspired the hashtag, ""#HotJesus"". It went viral on Twitter. The actor told The New York Times he doesn't want his looks to distract from the movie, but, ""If the message of Jesus was love, hope and compassion, and I can bring that to more people by being a more appealing Jesus, I am happy with that."" Clearly we have a new trend. A ""more appealing"" Jesus is not just a better prophet, he's ... sexy. We actually don't know what Jesus looked like. We do know he was a carpenter, so perhaps Jesus was buff. But, I don't think when the Biblical Nathaniel asked, ""Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?"" and Phillip answered, ""Come and see,"" they were talking about Jesus' beautiful face or chiseled abs. Yes, Jesus, as portrayed in countless paintings, has a six-pack. As comedian and author, Greg Behrendt joked, ""I'd like to get ripped ... ripped like Jesus. Jesus was ripped. You've seen the pictures, right? He's ripped! Ripped. He's the son of God. He's not going to be walking around saying I've got back fat today, I'm so puffy."" All joking aside, why must Jesus be sexy? Or ripped? Or even handsome? The Rev. Robert B. Lawton, SJ, a Jesuit priest and former president of Loyola Marymount University, says, ""There is absolutely no indication that Jesus was good-looking and sexy. In fact there is a passage in the prophet Isaiah that is taken as referring to Jesus.  It says this: . ""He had no form or majesty that we should look at him/nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by others; a man of suffering and acquainted with infirmity; and as one from whom others hide their faces he was despised, and we held him of no account."" (Isaiah 53. 2-3.) While this might not be conclusive evidence, it's quite possible that Jesus was no Jewish Brad Pitt from Palestine. On the other hand, why wouldn't God create a perfect Son? ""Anything that is sexy is going to attract people. People who might not go to the movie might want to check it out, particularly non-Christians,"" says the Rev. Lisa Jenkins, senior pastor of St. Matthew's Baptist Church in Harlem. ""I don't see a problem with Jesus being attractive given our cultural context,"" she says. ""I don't recall a Jesus who was not appealing to the eye. That's Hollywood."" Jenkins is more concerned about what she considers an inaccurate portrayal of Jesus' ethnicity. The Rev. James Martin, SJ, editor-at-large for America Magazine, and author of the coming book, ""Jesus: A Pilgrimage,"" agrees. ""God did not choose to incarnate himself in Laguna Beach,"" he says. ""He chose to incarnate Himself at a certain place, at a certain time in a certain person.""  And that person was a Palestinian Jew. ""Many people have a hard time with the humanity of Jesus ... the closer He is to human physical  perfection, the easier it is for some to accept Him."" But, Martin says, there is a danger in that too. A physically perfect Jesus makes Him into a God pretending to be man.  When Jesus was both human and divine. ""He was like us in all things, except sin, as the theology goes,"" Martin says. ""That means, He had a body, He got sick, He got tired, He may have sprained an ankle or two. There are passages in the Gospel showing Him falling asleep because He was tired. We tend to airbrush the physical imperfections away."" Those traits make Jesus so much more accessible. So much more ... human. I tried to come up with a living person to compare to Jesus. That, of course, is impossible. The closest I can come, as a Catholic, is Pope Francis. I've grown to revere him. Is it because he's sexy? In a word: No.","A film starring Diogo Morgado as Jesus opens this week .

"(CNN) -- There's no question that losing your job can be a jolting experience, as anyone who has had the misfortune of being laid off in recent years can attest. But what if that jolt could be a positive experience? That's the suggestion to come out of recent research which looked into the experiences of laid-off mid-to senior-level managers in the United States and Australia. The participants' overwhelming response was that the experience of losing their jobs in the previous 12 months had given them a renewed interest in living according to their values. The ""crisis"" of redundancy was in fact an opportunity to get to better know themselves, and reassess their priorities to lead more fulfilled, happier lives. ""All of the respondents, which surprised us, talked about the positives associated with this jolt of job loss,"" said study co-author Amy Kenworthy, a professor of management at Australia's Bond University. ""These people took that jolt and focused on the positives of it to recalibrate themselves in terms of 'Who am I and what do I want from life?' It was counter-intuitive with what we thought was going to take place."" Read more: Want to be a leader? Act like one . Kenworthy said as their research was exploratory, and focused specifically on the experiences of those in middle-to upper-management, it did not necessarily represent everybody's experiences. She said it reflected the way people could lose themselves and gradually become divorced from their personal values as they climbed the corporate ladder. Only a quarter of the responses from participants -- who ranged in age from their early 30s to late 50s, and nearly half of whom held doctorates -- related to feelings of self-doubt and cynicism, which the researchers had assumed would be the predominant response. ""It's normal to be angry and upset and scared and frustrated, and to experience not only self-doubt, but cynicism about the process and the organization,"" said Kenworthy. Instead, the respondents expressed a desire to lead their lives with more ""authenticity"" and integrity, even if it meant forgoing corporate benefits or a high salary -- perhaps a luxury that former mid-to senior-level managers can afford. Their new priorities fit into three clear categories: the desire for a more balanced quality of life, with more time for family and friends; more meaningful work which they felt contributed to society; and job security and happiness. ""People said things like: 'I didn't realize how toxic work my environment was, and how important a criterion that should be',"" said co-author Suzanne de Janasz, professor of leadership and organization development at Swiss business school IMD. Said Kenworthy: ""All of them expressed a genuine desire to be true to oneself as they moved forward to the next chapter of their careers. It was everything from 'I want to spend more time with my kids' to 'I know I have much more creative talent than I was able to demonstrate in my last job.'"" Read more: Why we pick bad leaders . Two respondents had opted to write books following their redundancy. ""For many of us, at some level inertia takes over. It's the comfort of the routine, the comfort of the expected. It's hard to break out of that,"" said Kenworthy. ""The jolt of job loss may in fact be something that is very useful to people and there may be some very clear benefits to come from it."" The authors said there were lessons for organizations from their research: that cutting back hours and salaries might be a mutually satisfactory way of getting through lean times, as it would allow employees to address their work-life balance. Where layoffs were unavoidable, organizations could offer affected employees workshops to help them to assess and prioritize their values, rather than simply update their resumes. More broadly, the findings were a useful reminder, as the times of economic uncertainty continued, that there was always a potential upside to a downturn. ""There is something we can take from the Chinese written language that they have understood for a very long time -- that crisis can mean opportunity,"" said Kenworthy. ""We don't frame things that way, but maybe we should.""","New research suggests that redundancy can ""jolt"" people into happier, more fulfilled lives .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- People in big cities walk past them every day -- street performers, or buskers. Some are talented, some are not, and most aren't performing for a cause greater than themselves. But on Monday, 12-year-old Abby Miller was. Abby Miller sings for her friend Taylor Love outside Washington's Union Station on Monday. She was performing outside Washington's Union Station to help her 4-year-old friend, Taylor Love, who is suffering from cancer. Abby sat in front of the station with a couple of her friends, singing songs and strumming a guitar. Passers-by seemed to notice the girl's singing talent, stopping to listen in the chilly weather, with a few putting money in a bucket at Abby's feet. Abby said the money will help support Taylor's family. A few more stopped to write messages on ""Love Notes,"" little cards designed to encourage Taylor Love through the tough time. ""Her mom reads them to her before she goes to bed at night,"" Abby said. ""Taylor gets excited for them and she loves getting them read to her because she likes knowing that people are supporting her and people are actually thinking of her."" Taylor has neuroblastoma, a cancer that affects the nervous system. According to her Web site, she is in remission, but this type of cancer has a high risk of recurrence. There has been little research on the illness, of which there are about 650 new cases in the United States each year. Mike Gillette, a family friend of both Taylor and Abby, brought the two girls together. While raising money and support for Taylor is important, he said, he thinks Abby's outreach can help bring more critical awareness for the devastating disease. ""She really wanted to reach people all over the country,"" he said. Gillette said he has taken Abby to do similar performances in the District of Columbia, New Jersey and Virginia, and estimates they've raised thousands of dollars and have gotten people to write several hundred ""Love Notes."" Abby does more than just raise money and awareness for her friend. Taylor's mother, Aimee, said that although Abby is eight years older than Taylor, the two see each other often and have a special connection that helps her get through her daughter's illness. ""I think it's amazing for a 12-year-old Abby to be drawn to my daughter, who is 4 and wants to inspire other children,"" Aimee Love said. ""The joy I see in Taylor when she sees Abby brings a light into my life."" Taylor's family said her treatments are terribly painful. But Abby said Taylor has enormous character. ""She's the most happy girl in the world, which I think is just incredible,"" Abby said. ""She's so much fun to be around. She's a little 4-year-old girl but she's got a heart of like a thousand grown adults."" Aimee Love said her daughter feels the same way about Abby. ""It gives her someone to aspire to, someone to be inspired by,"" she said.","Abby Miller sings, plays guitar to help 4-year-old friend with cancer .
